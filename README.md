# Avocado Prices: Organic or Conventional? 

## Deliverable 1
### Selected topic

The topic we have selected is the prices of avocados and what variables effect the price. Is it the type of avocado, for example does organic type make the price higher, or is the season/region? We aim to answer questions similar to these and see the real reason for the prices of avocados. 

### Reason they selected the topic

The reason we have selected the topic was due to the shared loved of avocados from half of the group. We saw this dataset and knew this is what we wanted to do our project over. While the dataset may need to be cleaned, we believe this is a great data source to complete the project. 

### Description of the source of data

We discovered this dataset on Kaggle by Hass Avocado Board Website (2013-2020). This dataset has 13 columns, including: average price, total volume, product look-up code, bag sizes of avocados, the type of avocados, year, and geography of where the avocado was being sold. This dataset has over 30,000 rows of data. 

### Questions they hope to answer with the data

Are the avocado's being bought going to be conventional or organic? The type of the avocado could indicate a reason why the price is the way it is. 


## Deliverable 2

The following descriptions and explination are provided for the machine learning role of this final project:
### Team members submit the code for their machine learning model:

### Description of preliminary data preprocessing:  
The chosen dataset has 13 columns and 30,022 rows of data. I checked for null data and null rows. I determined the datatypes of each column and the intergrity of the ata for mistakes. 

### Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decisionmaking process 


### Description of how data was split into training and testing sets  


### Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
