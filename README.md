# data_project

## Description of the data exploration phase of the project:
- We want to see where the best locations would be to set up Chipotle stores around the country.
- First, we looked at the prices statewide to give us a general understanding. 
- Then, we moved onto specific regions and then cities.
- We will be using Tableau for our data exploration and by using the “Details” function, users can hover over each individual visual to see the exact averages.

## Description of the analysis phase of the project:
- Clean the data
  - Remove null values
  - Ambiguity values ex: Total U.S was too broad 
  - Changing the nomical value to numeric value
- Take the cleaned data (CSV) and create a database 
  - Create an ERD - Entity–relationship model
  - PostgresSQL will be used 
  - Creat tables
    - Inner join
- Take the tables that was created and apply Machine Learning to answer our main question: Are the avocado's being bought going to be conventional or organic? Which  location would be the best to sell avocados to as Chipotles endeavor in a new avocado product?
